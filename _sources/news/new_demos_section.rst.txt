New demos section
=================

The examples section in the HyperSpy website has been replaced by a new `demos
<https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/hyperspy/hyperspy-demos/tree/main/>`_
section.

The demos are
in the form of IPython notebooks and contain examples of usage. They can be
viewed online and downloaded for interactive execution.

Everybody is encouraged to contribute demos by making a `pull request
<https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>`_ to the
`hyperspy-demos github repository
<https://github.com/hyperspy/hyperspy-demos>`_
or by email to the `hyperspy users mailing list
<https://groups.google.com/group/hyperspy-users>`_.
