New interactive demos
=====================

Interactive demos have been added to HyperSpy!

The demos (available in the |hyperspy-demos| repository) are Jupyter notebooks and have
been updated to be compatible with the latest version of HyperSpy.
It is not necessary to download or install anything to give them a try, as all the code
can be run remotely on the `mybinder.org <https://mybinder.org>`_ servers.
See the |readme| of |hyperspy-demos| for more instructions and details on how to get started.
