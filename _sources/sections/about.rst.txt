About
=====

*HyperSpy* is an open source Python toolbox facilitating the (interactive) analysis
of multi-dimensional datasets (hyperspectral images) that has over time grown
into an ecosystem including different extension packages dedicated to certain
experimental methods.

The development of *HyperSpy* has been motivated by the data analysis needs of the
electron microscopy community, but in the meantime it is proving useful in many
other fields.

Brief History
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Originally developed as *EELSlab* starting in 2007, the package was renamed to
*HyperSpy* in 2010 and open-sourced on GitHub when the broader value for the
analysis of analytical electron microscopy data became apparent.

In 2015, *HyperSpy* was migrated to Python 3. The last version supporting
Python 2 was 0.8.3. The first major release, version 1.0.0, was announced in 2016.

In 2019, with :external+hyperspy:ref:`version 1.5.0 <changes_1.5>`, the mechanism
to register extension packages was introduced and subsequently first domain-specific
packages were developed. With the second major release, :external+hyperspy:ref:`version
2.0.0 <changes_2.0>`, code dedicated to specific methods was
split out of *HyperSpy* and the input-output capabilities were moved
to the dedicated package `RosettaSciIO <https://hyperspy.org/rosettasciio>`_.
